# Tic-Tac-Toe

## What I Learned

This project was specifically focused on mastering **JavaScript architecture patterns**. Here's what I learned:

### JavaScript Architecture & Design Patterns

- **Module Pattern with IIFE** - Creating self-contained modules with private scope and controlled public interfaces
- **Factory Functions** - Using factory functions to create multiple instances with encapsulated data (Player factory)
- **Closures for Data Privacy** - Leveraging closures within modules to keep internal state private while exposing only necessary methods
- **Matrix Operations** - Working with 2D arrays to represent the game board and implementing algorithms to check winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals
- **Separation of Concerns** - Dividing the application into distinct modules: game logic (`boardGame`), UI control (`domController`), and application flow (`ticTacToeGame`)

### CSS Techniques

- **Container Queries** - Using container query units (`cqi`) for responsive typography that scales based on container size rather than viewport
- **CSS Grid for Game Layout** - Creating a perfect 3x3 grid layout with proper border management
- **Box-shadow for Borders** - Using `box-shadow` instead of `border` to fix visual gaps caused by browser rendering issues

### Concepts I Applied from Previous Projects

- CSS custom properties, animations, and hover effects
- Event handling and DOM manipulation
- Array methods and functional programming approaches

This project helped me understand how to structure larger JavaScript applications with clear separation of concerns and data encapsulation.
